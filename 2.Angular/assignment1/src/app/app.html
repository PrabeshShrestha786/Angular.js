<!-- This solution creates a new component that receives weather text from its parent component. 
The parent (App) defines a string variable called yesterdayWeather. 
In the template, the parent passes that value to the child component using property binding: [data]="yesterdayWeather". 
Inside the child component, @Input() data allows the child to accept the value coming from the parent. 
Finally, the child template prints the received value using interpolation with {{ data }}.-->
